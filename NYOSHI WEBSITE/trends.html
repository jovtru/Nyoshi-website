        <p>
          Globally, over 70 percent of businesses have a website, and around
          10,500 websites are created every hour. According to Forbes, the
          average user takes 0.05 seconds to form their opinion of a website,
          and this impression is 94 percent related to design. Staying
          up-to-date with the latest trends in web design has never been more
          important.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">5 Trends in Web Design to Consider</div>

        <h2>1. Animations and Illustrations</h2>
        <p>
          Animations have become popular in modern web design. The trend of
          micro-animations will continue in 2024. They should remain subtle and
          powerful, bringing the overall experience to life instead of
          distracting or overwhelming users. Micro-animations can illuminate
          what’s important on a page, drawing your attention to specific text or
          images.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illustrations have begun to replace photography, which aligns with
          another trend of optimizing website loading speed. Illustrated images
          tend to load faster because they often have smaller file sizes.
          There’s creative space for illustrations to convey unique ideas and
          concepts that photographs cannot. While high-quality illustrations can
          be expensive, they have massive potential to benefit brands and their
          bottom lines.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Accessibility and Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>
          Organizations are keen to ensure accessibility and inclusivity at
          every point of the business, which extends to web design. There’s a
          shift toward cutting back on special effects that might create
          surprise or shock, as well as auditing a website’s colors, layout, and
          navigation to ensure it’s accessible to those with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inclusive web design ensures a website is usable, culturally
          sensitive, ethically responsible, intuitive, and age-appropriate. It
          means curating images that feature people of diverse backgrounds,
          making core features usable for all, and designing a consistent
          experience across devices and browsers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Responsive Design Across Devices</h2>
        <p>
          A trend that ties with accessibility and inclusivity is developing
          responsive design for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
          “Thumb-friendly mobile design” refers to making websites navigable
          with just your thumb. This involves keeping ergonomics in mind to help
          users reduce strain. How can users reach the menu, select options, and
          navigate the site with their thumb? Designers can optimize this
          experience with user research and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another component of responsive design is speed. According to Google,
          bounce rates increase by 32 percent when a page takes three seconds to
          load instead of one. Pages that are heavy with stunning graphics can
          take longer to load and, therefore, perform worse in search engine
          results than a simpler design.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Personalized and Geo-Located Content</h2>
        <p>
          Geo-location is a trend that will continue in 2024, especially for
          e-commerce websites. A geo-located website shows different content,
          language, currency, weather, and news based on the user’s location.
          Based on this information, websites can further personalize content,
          such as adjusting layout or colors, or enable push notifications and
          targeted marketing (such as paid media and social media advertising)
          to provide discounts and recommendations.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Abstract and Nostalgic Designs</h2>
        <p>
          The trend in 2024 is to employ abstract designs and tug at
          heartstrings with nostalgic visuals. Many websites focus on simplicity
          in design, such as unique lines, two-toned color schemes, and
          retro-style typography. Textures or art used in web design are
          increasingly abstract and gradient, opting for sweeping colors and
          shapes that evoke emotions and memories of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web designers emphasize white space alongside the abstract as a nod to
          minimalism, paring down to the basics. Whether it is a site featuring
          a sneaker brand, holistic wellness, or a food waste volunteer group,
          increasing the white space between sections, paragraphs, and imagery
          creates a balance for the eyes and mind to highlight what’s important.
